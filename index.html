                        95 percent water.

            <p id="p1">
                Lacking brains, blood, or even hearts, jellyfish are pretty
                simple critters. They are composed of three layers: an outer layer,
                the epidermis; a middle layer made of a thick, elastic, jelly-like
                substance called mesoglea; and an inner layer, called the gastrodermis.
                An elementary nervous system, or nerve net, allows jellyfish to smell,
                detect light, and respond to other stimuli. The simple digestive
                cavity of a jellyfish acts as both its stomach and intestine, with
                one opening for both the mouth and the anus.
            </p>

            <p id="p2">
                These simple invertebrates are members of the phylum Cnidaria, which
                includes creatures such as sea anemones, sea whips, and corals.
                Like all members of the phylum, the body parts of a jellyfish radiate
                from a central axis. This “radial symmetry” allows jellyfish to detect
                and respond to food or danger from any direction.
            </p>

            <p id="p3">
                Jellyfish have the ability to sting with their tentacles.
                While the severity of stings varies, in humans, most jellyfish stings
                result only in minor discomfort.
